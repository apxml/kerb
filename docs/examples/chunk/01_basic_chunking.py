"""Basic Text Chunking Example

This example demonstrates fundamental chunking approaches for LLM applications.

Main concepts:
- Simple character-based chunking
- Overlap between chunks for context preservation
- Quick utility functions for common tasks

Use cases:
- Splitting large documents for LLM processing
- Creating chunks with context overlap
- Basic text preprocessing

Key Takeaways:
- simple_chunker: Basic fixed-size chunks, good for uniform processing
- overlap_chunker: Adds context overlap, better for maintaining coherence
- chunk_text: Quick utility for common chunking needs
- Overlap is crucial for RAG systems to preserve context across chunks
- Choose chunk size based on your LLM's context window and task needs
