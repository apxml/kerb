"""LLM-as-Judge Evaluation.

This example demonstrates how to use LLM-as-judge for evaluating outputs
when you don't have ground truth or want human-like quality assessment.
Common use cases:
- Evaluating open-ended generation tasks
- Comparing multiple model outputs
- Assessing qualities that are hard to measure automatically
- Replacing expensive human evaluation
