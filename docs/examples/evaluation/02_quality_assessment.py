"""Quality Assessment for LLM Outputs.

This example demonstrates how to assess the quality of LLM-generated content
without requiring ground truth references. Common use cases:
- Detecting hallucinations in generated content
- Assessing faithfulness to source documents (RAG systems)
- Evaluating answer relevance to questions
- Measuring coherence and fluency
