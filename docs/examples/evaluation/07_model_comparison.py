"""Model Comparison and Selection.

This example demonstrates how to systematically compare multiple LLM models
to select the best one for your use case. Common use cases:
- Comparing different model providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- Selecting between model versions (GPT-3.5 vs GPT-4)
- Evaluating open-source vs proprietary models
- Cost-performance tradeoffs
