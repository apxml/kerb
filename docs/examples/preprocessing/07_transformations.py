"""Text Transformations for Data Standardization

This example demonstrates text transformation techniques to standardize
training data for consistent LLM input formats.

Main concepts:
- Expanding contractions for formal text
- Standardizing numbers and dates
- Sentence and word segmentation
- Entity extraction (basic)
- Text normalization for consistency

Use case: Standardizing diverse text sources for uniform LLM training
